# multicare-CMS-analysis
Interview project for Multicare Health Systems ASME team

Data taken from  https://data.cms.gov/medicare-shared-savings-program/county-level-aggregate-expenditure-and-risk-score-data-on-assignable-beneficiaries

Asked to analyze trends in available variables (expenditures, person years & risk score) from 2019 - 2023 for the Aged / Non - Dual population for following WA counties:

 - King
 - Pierce
 - Kitsap
 - Spokane
 - Thurston
 - Yakima

## Feedback/Areas of Improvement:
 * Analysis as a toggleable Excel dashboard
 * 'Zoomed-out' analysis
   * Comparing data to nationwide average
   * Avoids limiting analysis to 5 counties
 * Writing trends as "X_AGND saw Y% increase/decrease over Z time period"
   * Better than throwing graphs at viewer and having vague bullets
   * Focuses on trends and notable features (i.e. King county having most person years)
 * Validity of correlation analysis for this sort of data
